## React Router Vending Machine
For this assignment, you should use the React Router to build a vending machine!

What does this mean? Your application should consist of the following:

A `VendingMachine` component, which shows a page with a list of snacks that you can get from the vending machine.
At least three different snack components, each one corresponding to a vending machine snack.
By clicking on an item in the `VendingMachine` you can view one of things inside of the machine. Clicking should update the `URL` and show the snack that youâ€™ve clicked on.
From each snack component, you should be able to go back to the main `VendingMachine` component.
